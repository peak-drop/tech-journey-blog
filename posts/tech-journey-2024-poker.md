In poker, knowing the best hands helps you win. The top hand is a Royal Flush (A, K, Q, J, 10 of the same suit), which
beats everything. A Straight Flush (five cards in a row of the same suit) is the next best hand. If you get these, bet
big!

Other strong hands are Four of a Kind (four cards of the same rank), Full House (three of one rank, two of another), and
Flush (five cards of the same suit). These hands usually win, so play them confidently.

Common hands like a Straight (five cards in a row), Three of a Kind (three cards of the same rank), Two Pair, and One
Pair are decent but can be beaten. The weakest hand is High Card (no pairs, just the highest card you have). Knowing
these hands helps you decide when to bet or fold. Happy playing!
